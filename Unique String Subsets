Difficulty: Medium

Description:
Given a string s, return all unique subsets of the string. The subsets should be returned in lexicographically sorted order. Each subset should be sorted lexicographically.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: ["", "a", "ab", "abc", "ac", "b", "bc", "c"]

Example 2:

Input: s = "aab"
Output: ["", "a", "aa", "aab", "ab", "b"]

Constraints:

The length of s will be in the range [1, 16].
s will consist of lowercase English letters.
Follow-up: Can you solve this problem in an iterative manner?
