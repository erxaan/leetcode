Difficulty: Medium

Description:
Given a string `s`, return all unique subsets of the string. The subsets should be returned in lexicographically sorted order. Each subset should be sorted lexicographically.

Example 1:
Input: `s = "abc"`
Output: `["", "a", "ab", "abc", "ac", "b", "bc", "c"]`

Example 2:
Input: `s = "aab"`
Output: `["", "a", "aa", "aab", "ab", "b"]`

Constraints:
- The length of `s` will be in the range [1, 16].
- `s` will consist of lowercase English letters.

Follow-up: Can you solve this problem in an iterative manner?
